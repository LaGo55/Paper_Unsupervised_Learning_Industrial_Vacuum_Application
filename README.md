The included files represent an exemplatory implementation of the a data analysis project that aims to retrieve industrial insights from a field dataset of a vacuum pump.
The raw dataset is not publically available. Atlas Copco provided a dataset for the purpose of this paper. Only the preprocessed and anomised data is therefore available publically.

The demonstrated scripts provide simple examples of how to analyse the data and show two approaches of how to generate industrial insights. Be aware that the code is of practical nature and not developed for efficiency. This example does not represent my professional coding and simplified for educational purposes.
